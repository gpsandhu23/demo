# Commercely
Repository for the commerce platform of the future powered by AI!

Commercely is a product that enables commerce in the age of AI. It stores all kinds of commerce data like credit cards, cryptocurrencies and next-gen cash NFT equivalents. It is literally a money making machine!

It is written in Java using Spring Boot, exposes REST APIs with React JS as the front end. The services run on Kubernetes clusters. It uses Mongo DB as the storage solution. The entire application stack runs in AWS. It also uses Stripe for some processing and Office 365 for all the employees.

Some microservices use OpenAI APIs but we also have the options to bring your own LLM via Huggingface or some other mechanism.
